              <p>
                I am a life-long nerd with a passion for pretty visuals. âœ¨
                Thanks to an early interest in gaming I have always had an a
                thing for tech, but it was not something I thought to pursue as
                a career until it was time to apply to uni. Before that I
                studied film & visual design and had dreams of going into the
                special effects industry. But when I found out I could combine
                my creative side with tech in the role as frontend developer, I
                applied to study web development at uni and haven't looked back
                since!
                <br />
                <br />
                I'm looking for roles where I can utilize my skills in areas
                that are relevant to my interests, passions or values and allow
                me to make a difference. I love to learn new things and try out
                new technologies, although React, Next.js and Tailwind will
                always be my favorite children.
